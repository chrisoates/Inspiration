Inspiration
===========
This is a text animator which uses javascript and CSS3 transformations and transitions to 'read out' text in a conversational style.

Basics
======
The javascript 'paginates' the paragraphs and displays each span after a delay specified by the value of its 'class'

eg 	<span class="2">text</span> will display after a delay of 2 seconds
	<span class="4">text</span> will display after a delay of 4 seconds
	
Displaying is actually done by colouring the text, it's not actually hidden, it's just white.

You have to adjust the animation-duration depending on how many spans and their display delays contained within the paragraph. More spans will require the animation-duration to be extended to match.

Notes
=====
Webkit browsers only.
Noticed that sometimes the first run isn't perfect but after that it's fine.
